# Heart-disease-risk-prediction
Interpretable machine learning models for early cardiovascular disease risk prediction using routine clinical data.
This project uses interpretable machine learning models to predict cardiovascular disease risk from routine clinical data.

**Models:** Logistic Regression, Random Forest  
**Metrics:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC  
**Dataset:** De-identified cardiovascular datasets from the Hack4Health Byte 2 Beat hackathon.

See the notebook for full analysis and results.
